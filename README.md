# Work In Progress: Not ready for use
The `Catalog of Books` is a Quarkus based micro-service that is part of the `Home Librarian` application which is intented to be used as part of my OKD 4 UPI tutorial.  See https://github.com/cgruver/okd4-upi-lab-setup


This application is not ready yet.  This README will be updated when the code is ready.
